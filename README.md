## About The Project

The System Application, mine-sweeeper was designed mimic the classic game mine-sweeper.  The idea of the game, is to test your mind with puzzles.

This was a little side project, to get me to understand system programming better.  Highlights of the project include memory allocation, algorithms for mines, and use of Code Point UTF-8.

### Built With
* C++

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to clone this github file.  Then you need to compile the code with command
```sh
g++ io-utilities.cpp mineSweeperGame.cpp mineSweeper.cpp stringPlus.cpp
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jyee5/mine-sweeper.git
```
2.  Compile the Code with the commands below
```sh
g++ io-utilities.cpp mineSweeperGame.cpp mineSweeper.cpp stringPlus.cpp
```
3.  Run the code using replacing in values with real numbers
```sh
./a.out lenght width %of how many mines
```
4.  Follow instructions of game


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Objective

The objective of the game is to clear the entire board without picking on a mine.  If you open a square and there are mines nearby, it will show you how many are nearby.  This is the only hint that will allow you to find the mine.
